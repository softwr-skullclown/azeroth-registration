# azeroth-registration

Azeroth Registration is an open source webapp for registering with an [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) private server, though may work with other projects like [MaNGOS](https://www.getmangos.eu/) or [TrinityCore](https://www.trinitycore.org/) as long as the primary auth database models are in alignment.
